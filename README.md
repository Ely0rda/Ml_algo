## Overview

This project contains implementations of essential machine learning algorithms built from the ground up. Rather than relying solely on high-level libraries, these implementations focus on the underlying mathematics and optimization techniques that power machine learning. The goal is to provide clear, educational implementations that demonstrate how these algorithms work internally.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
  - Univariate Linear Regression
  - Multivariate Linear Regression
  - Feature Scaling techniques
  
- **Logistic Regression**
  - Binary classification
  - Gradient descent optimization
  
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Z-score normalization
  - Feature scaling for multi-variable models

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting results
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment for algorithm implementation and testing
- **Scikit-learn**: For comparing custom implementations against standard library implementations

## Key Features

1. **Pure Python/NumPy Implementations**: Algorithms are built using only NumPy for mathematical operations, without relying on ML libraries for the core functionality
2. **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Custom implementation of gradient descent for both linear and logistic regression
3. **Feature Scaling Techniques**: Implementation of z-score normalization and other scaling approaches
4. **Visualization**: Comprehensive plotting of learning curves, decision boundaries, and model predictions
5. **Comparison with Scikit-learn**: Verification of custom implementations against industry-standard libraries

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ml_algo.git
   cd Ml_algo
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Running the Jupyter Notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any of the algorithm notebooks to see the implementations with explanations.

### Linear Regression Example

```python
# Load the univariate linear regression implementation
from univariate_linear_regression import compute_fwb, derivatives, compute_gd

# Sample training data
x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])

# Initialize parameters
w_init = 0.0
b_init = 0.0
alpha = 1.0e-2
iterations = 10000

# Run gradient descent
w, b, J_history = compute_gd(w_init, b_init, x_train, y_train, alpha, iterations)

# Make predictions
predictions = compute_fwb(x_train, w, b)
```

### Feature Scaling Example

```python
# Load the feature scaling implementation
from Feature_Scalling_Multivariable import zscore_norm

# Normalize the features
x_norm, x_mu, x_sigma = zscore_norm(x_train)

# Run gradient descent on normalized data
w_norm, b_norm, J_history = compute_gd(x_norm, y_train, w_i, b_i, 1000, 1.0e-1)
```
